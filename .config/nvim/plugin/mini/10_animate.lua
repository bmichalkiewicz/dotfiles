-- Animate common Neovim actions. Like cursor movement, scroll, window resize,
-- window open, window close. Animations are done based on Neovim events and
-- don't require custom mappings.
--
-- It is not enabled by default because its effects are a matter of taste.
-- Also scroll and resize have some unwanted side effects (see `:h mini.animate`).
-- Uncomment next line (use `gcc`) to enable.
