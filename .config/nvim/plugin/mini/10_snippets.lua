-- Manage and expand snippets (templates for a frequently used text).
-- Typical workflow is to type snippet's (configurable) prefix and expand it
-- into a snippet session.
--
-- How to manage snippets:
-- - 'mini.snippets' itself doesn't come with preconfigured snippets. Instead there
--   is a flexible system of how snippets are prepared before expanding.
--   They can come from pre-defined path on disk, 'snippets/' directories inside
--   config or plugins, defined inside `setup()` call directly.
-- - This config, however, does come with snippet configuration:
--     - 'snippets/global.json' is a file with global snippets that will be
--       available in any buffer
--     - 'after/snippets/lua.json' defines personal snippets for Lua language
--     - 'friendly-snippets' plugin configured in 'plugin/40_plugins.lua' provides
--       a collection of language snippets
--
-- How to expand a snippet in Insert mode:
-- - If you know snippet's prefix, type it as a word and press `<C-j>`. Snippet's
--   body should be inserted instead of the prefix.
-- - If you don't remember snippet's prefix, type only part of it (or none at all)
--   and press `<C-j>`. It should show picker with all snippets that have prefixes
--   matching typed characters (or all snippets if none was typed).
--   Choose one and its body should be inserted instead of previously typed text.
--
-- How to navigate during snippet session:
-- - Snippets can contain tabstops - places for user to interactively adjust text.
--   Each tabstop is highlighted depending on session progression - whether tabstop
--   is current, was or was not visited. If tabstop doesn't yet have text, it is
--   visualized with special "ghost" inline text: • and ∎ by default.
-- - Type necessary text at current tabstop and navigate to next/previous one
--   by pressing `<C-l>` / `<C-h>`.
-- - Repeat previous step until you reach special final tabstop, usually denoted
--   by ∎ symbol. If you spotted a mistake in an earlier tabstop, navigate to it
--   and return back to the final tabstop.
-- - To end a snippet session when at final tabstop, keep typing or go into
--   Normal mode. To force end snippet session, press `<C-c>`.
